# The-Cistern-Build
A windows build of my game: The Cistern. I don't promise that it is up to date. 

To use the game, click the green code button then "downlad as zip". After that, extract the files and run "The Cistern.exe" 

Controlls:
arrow keys to move
c to slash
shift to walk

See if you can get a high score!
